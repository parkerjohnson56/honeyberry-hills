Your final project for this course requires you to use your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS to build a single-page site that you will be able to include in your portfolio. Often when applying for jobs and internships you will be asked to share a completed project that you built and to speak about the work you did on that project. This assignment will be one that you can include in your portfolio.

The site can be for a real or fictional company or person. Depending on the type of job you hope to find after graduation, you may want to choose a subject that will illustrate the kind of work you can do. If you'd like to work in-house, building a site for a company could be the way to go.

The Requirements
There will be two parts to this assignment:

Your coded site, to include semantic HTML, appropriate CSS (your site is not required to be responsive), and JS. ALL of the code written for this page must be written from scratch by you (Do not copy code from the internet and include it in your project). Please see and review the academic integrity policy for more information. First, you'll have some required elements:
The site will be a single page, and should display properly at 1280px wide
The page should look like a real, stand-alone website. Users should see all of the kind of content that they would expect from any professional website. No placeholder text is allowed, text and photos should be realistic and high-quality, and everything you'd expect to see should be present (header, navigation (even within the page), footer, etc.
ALL of your files, including any JS, HTML or CSS should be well organized, properly indented, well-commented, and appropriate (in terms of content and layout).
Your HTML and CSS should validate without errors or warnings.
There should not be ANY JavaScript or CSS in your HTML (no inline event handlers, no inline CSS, only HTML goes in your HTML file)
When viewing your site in the browser, no errors should be visible in the console.
Add the async or defer attribute to your script tag in the header to prevent errors on page load with the JS.
Your JS should "use strict"; globally
PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR FILES TO YOUR ASU WEBSPACE OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC ONLINE LOCATION UNLESS YOU OBFUSCATE YOUR JSLinks to an external site. FIRST
These elements are required for the project/code (include all four items on your site):

jQuery Widget/Plugin - Use at least one on your site. We practiced with the tabs and accordion in class, but you aren't limited to only using one of those two. (Module 6 - More jQuery, with AJAX and Plugins)
Use Ajax/API - Include a section/area where you load some kind of content to the page, either from a third-party API or from a JSON file that you create. (The movie database activity shows loading content from an API and the cupcake page activity shows loading content from a JSON file using Postman). You could allow the users to "page" through results in this section by only loading a few products/items at a time, or you can display them all at once. It's up to you! This should include at least three pieces of content (three movies, three portfolio projects, etc. Whatever your site topic is, choose content to support that). (Module 2 - JSON, AJAX, Third-Party APIS and/or Module 6 - More jQuery with AJAX and Plugins)
Web Storage - Use web storage on your site to store/display some info for the user. This could be content you write to their web storage and then retrieve/display on page load or it could be content that you allow the user to enter into a form, then store in web storage and display to them. The web storage activity (we downloaded starter files for that, you should have them on your computer) shows how to write and retrieve/display content in web storage. (Module 3 - Web Storage, Canvas Drawing, Transformations, and Animation)
Slideshow/Carousel - Include a slideshow/carousel of images (that can also include text if you'd like) using jQuery (plugin/widget) or another JavaScript library (research and find one you like). This should have at least three images in it. (Module 5 - JS Libraries: jQuery Introduction and Module 6 - More jQuery, with AJAX and Plugins)
A planned/prepared Behance project that explains your process. If you aren't sure what this should look like, here is a link to some ASU GIT moodboards on behance.Links to an external site. Your project should include these details:
Project requirements
What the requirements inspired you to create
An explanation of the goals/purpose/users of the site
The steps you took when building the site (include any mockups or wireframes or brainstorming documents - wireframes OR mockups will be required, plan to complete at least one of these as part of your process) These should include: discovery/goals/content gathering, design, writing the code, testing the site design and code, final look/functionality
The tools you used, sources of images and other assets (include these in code comments too to be safe)
Explanation of the next steps you would take and/or what you would do to add to or change the site with more time, what you struggled with, what you enjoyed the most, etc.
PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR JS IN THIS PROJECT
You can find more information about talking about your process as a developer hereLinks to an external site. (and a recording of this presentation on YouTubeLinks to an external site.). As well as from a past AIGA Poly Behance Workshop, here are some slides used in that workshopLinks to an external site.. Some students are more comfortable creating their presentation in Google Slides and embedding that presentation in Behance, which is fine. The point is more to get you in the habit of talking about your process and adding things to your portfolio. The more detail and the better the design and code, the more you'll have to share with interviewers when you graduate!
Tips for Success
START EARLY! The sooner you start to think about this assignment, the easier it will be to build. Determining the site's subject/company is a big step, and so is gathering content. Take a few small steps every week, and decide how you can best show off your skills.

ASK FOR HELP IF YOU NEED IT! If you realize that you aren't sure how to implement some part of the site, just ask. I am here to help and I want to see everyone finish the course with an interactive site that shows off what you've learned in this class and in the rest of the program. If you're struggling or if you need some tips once you decide what to build, I will help.

DO SOME RESEARCH! This could be research into interviewing and sharing your portfolio as a designer/developer, or research into how to best design your presentation for the most impact, or even research into how to build a site with good SEO or how to build a site that meets your user's goals. This is a 400-level course, so you probably have built up some of this knowledge in your other courses, but it's always a good idea to ensure that you're up-to-date on the latest research related to building sites for the web.

 

This project gives you a chance to show off all that you've learned and it can be a lot of fun to see how far you've come since entering the program. Students who complete the course have enjoyed building this site and seeing how what you've learned about HTML and CSS can work with what you now know about JS. Have fun with it!

 

The Submission:
  Your coded site, to include semantic HTML, appropriate CSS (your site is not required to be responsive), and JS. - This should be in a zipped folder with your JS that is not obfuscated so that I can read and review it.
A link to your Behance Project
You can use this checklist as you work on your projectLinks to an external site. to make sure that you're meeting the requirements for submission in case you aren't sure (this can be viewed by anyone logged in to Google with their ASU email address)
